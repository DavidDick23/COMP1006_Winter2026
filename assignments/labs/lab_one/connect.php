/*
    This lab has been a bit challenging as there were quite a few technical issues in setting up
    XAMPP and gaining access to phpmyadmin through my local host.

    I also had an interesting time getting used to the syntax involved with php and some functionality
    as it is quite different from C#. I wish there were #regions available to keep my code a bit
    more organized but I did not find any solution as of yet.

    All in all I found this to be a bit of a struggle, however, as this course continues I am sure
    the syntax will come a bit more naturally and the growing pains of working with XAMPP will
    diminish.
